## basic decoding

On platforms with built-in file system support (MacOS, Linux), decoding a JPEG file to a pixel array takes just two function calls.

```swift 
guard let image:JPEG.Data.Rectangular<JPEG.Common> = 
    try .decompress(path: "examples/decode-basic/karlie-kwk-2019.jpg")
else 
{
    fatalError("failed to open file '\(path)'")
}

let rgb:[JPEG.RGB] = image.unpack(as: JPEG.RGB.self)
```

The pixel unpacking can also be done with the `JPEG.YCbCr` built-in target, to obtain an image in its native [YCbCr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr) color space.

The `unpack(as:)` method is non-mutating, so you can unpack the same image to multiple color targets without having to re-decode the file each time.
